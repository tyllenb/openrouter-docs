# Vision
With tons of models to choose from, you are able to get the best models for your use case

## Vision Models

### Expanding Horizons Beyond Text

Historically, language models were confined to text input, limiting their applicability across various domains. OpenRouter's aggregation of vision capabilities mark a significant leap, broadening the spectrum of use cases and applications. This advancement enables the model to not only process text but also interpret and respond to image-based inputs. 

### Image Understanding and Interaction

**Image Input Processing**

The API accepts images as input, allowing the model to analyze and understand visual content. This feature opens up possibilities for a range of tasks, including but not limited to:

- Image-based question answering: The model can provide detailed responses to questions about the contents of an image.
- Object detection and classification: Identifying and categorizing objects within an image.
- Contextual understanding: Interpreting the context or setting depicted in an image.

**Bridging Visual and Textual Data**

By combining image processing with its robust language understanding, OpenRouter can seamlessly bridge the gap between visual and textual information. This integration allows for more nuanced and comprehensive AI applications, such as:

- Describing images in natural language.
- Generating text-based summaries of visual content.
- Enhancing accessibility through image descriptions for visually impaired users.

## Innovations in Multi-Modal AI

OpenRouter's vision capabilities represent a significant stride in multi-modal AI, where the model can process and synthesize information from both visual and textual inputs. This dual-input approach greatly enhances the model's versatility, making it suitable for a wide array of innovative applications:

- Creative arts and media generation.
- Advanced educational tools that combine visual aids with explanatory text.
- Enhanced customer service bots capable of understanding screenshots or product images.
- Research and analysis in fields that require combined interpretation of text and imagery.

## Building with Vision Models

Choose the language or tool you want to get started with using the OpenRouter API for the Vision models.

Here you will be using the same API enpoint as the completions models, but you will be changing the model and message content depending on the use case.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">Vision models on OpenRouter have the word `vision` generally appended to them. That way you can use those for vision purposes</Callout>

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['Typescript', 'Python', 'curl']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
## Step 1: Install Fetch API

Ensure that you have the Fetch API available in your environment. If you're using a modern browser or a Node.js version that supports it, you're all set. Otherwise, you may need to install a polyfill or use an alternative method for making HTTP requests.

You can install `node-fetch` by running the following command

```bash copy
npm install node-fetch
```

You can then import `fetch` at the top of your file like so

```typescript copy
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
```
## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API. Here's the basic structure you'll use, wrapped in a function for easy reuse:

```typescript filename="Use Model On OpenRouter" copy
  
  fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        "Authorization": \`Bearer \${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}\`,
        "HTTP-Referer": \`${YOUR_SITE_URL}\`, // Optional, for openrouter.ai rankings.
        "X-Title": \`${YOUR_SITE_NAME}\`, // Optional, for display in rankings.
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "google/gemini-pro-vision",
        messages: [
            {
                role: "user",
                content: [
                    { type: "text", text: "What’s in this image?" },
                    {
                        type: "image_url",
                        image_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
});
```
Replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `YOUR_SITE_URL`, and `YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual credentials and information.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

Once you've made the request, you'll want to handle the response to ensure that your application can process and display the results effectively.

```typescript filename="Add Response Handling" copy
fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {
  // ... (rest of the fetch request)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Response from OpenRouter:', data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

An example of a sample response
```typescript filename="Example Response" copy
{
  "id": "gen-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop", // Different models provide different reasons here
      "message": { // will be "delta" if streaming
        role: "assistant",
        content: "Hello there!"
      }
    }
  ],
  "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" // Could also be "anthropic/claude-2.1", etc, depending on the "model" that ends up being used
}
```

## Step 4: Handle Errors

You can log an errors you may encounter and use the codes to help debug what the problem might be.

You can adjust your code for handling errors by using the following code

```typescript filename="Error Handling code" copy
  const request = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/...")
  console.log(request.status) // Will be an error code unless the model started processing your request
  const response = await request.json()
  console.error(response.error?.status) // Will be an error code
  console.error(response.error?.message)
```

**Error Codes**

| Error Code | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 400        | Bad Request (invalid or missing params, CORS)           |
| 401        | Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key) |
| 402        | Out of credits                                          |
| 403        | Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged |
| 408        | Your request timed out                                  |
| 429        | You are being rate limited                              |
| 502        | Your chosen model is down or we received an invalid response from it |

## Step 1: Install Requests Library

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:

```bash copy
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API using Python's `requests` library. Here's the basic structure wrapped in a function for easy reuse:

```python filename="Use Model On OpenRouter" copy
import requests
import json

def send_request():
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
    YOUR_SITE_URL = "your_site_url_here"
    YOUR_APP_NAME = "your_app_name_here"

    response = requests.post(
        url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {OPENROUTER_API_KEY}",
            "HTTP-Referer": YOUR_SITE_URL,  # Optional, for openrouter.ai rankings.
            "X-Title": YOUR_APP_NAME,  # Optional, shows in rankings on openrouter.ai.
        },
        data=json.dumps({
            'model': "google/gemini-pro-vision",
            'messages': [
                {
                    'role': "user",
                    'content': [
                        {'type': "text", 'text': "What’s in this image?"},
                        {
                            'type': "image_url",
                            'image_url': "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        })
    )
    return response
```
Replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `YOUR_SITE_URL`, and `YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual credentials and information.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

Process the response from the API to handle the data effectively in your application.

```python filename="Add Response Handling" copy
  response = send_request()
  if response.status_code == 200:
      data = response.json()
      print('Response from OpenRouter:', data)
  else:
      print('Error:', response.status_code)
```

An example of a sample response
```typescript filename="Example Response" copy
{
  "id": "gen-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop", // Different models provide different reasons here
      "message": { // will be "delta" if streaming
        role: "assistant",
        content: "Hello there!"
      }
    }
  ],
  "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" // Could also be "anthropic/claude-2.1", etc, depending on the "model" that ends up being used
}
```

## Step 4: Handle Errors

You can log an errors you may encounter and use the codes to help debug what the problem might be.

You can adjust your code for handling errors by using the following code

```typescript filename="Error Handling code" copy
  const request = await fetch("https://openrouter.ai/...")
  console.log(request.status) // Will be an error code unless the model started processing your request
  const response = await request.json()
  console.error(response.error?.status) // Will be an error code
  console.error(response.error?.message)
```

**Error Codes**

| Error Code | Description                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 400        | Bad Request (invalid or missing params, CORS)           |
| 401        | Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key) |
| 402        | Out of credits                                          |
| 403        | Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged |
| 408        | Your request timed out                                  |
| 429        | You are being rate limited                              |
| 502        | Your chosen model is down or we received an invalid response from it |

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have `cURL` installed in your command-line environment. It's typically pre-installed on many Unix-like operating systems. If not, you can download and install it from [the cURL website](https://curl.haxx.se/).

## Step 2: Set Up Your cURL Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API using cURL. Here's the command you'll use:

```bash copy
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
        "model": "google/gemini-pro-vision",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    { "type": "text", "text": "What’s in this image?" },
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

In this command, replace `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Step 3: Execute the Request

Run the above command in your terminal. Ensure you have replaced `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Step 4: Understand the Response

Upon successful execution, the OpenRouter API will return a JSON response. You can process this response as per your requirement in your application or script.

## Step 5: Handle Errors

If there's an error in your request or with the API, cURL will display an error message. Refer to the below error codes for troubleshooting:

**Error Codes**

| Error Code | Description                                             |

| 400        | Bad Request (invalid or missing params, CORS)           |
| 401        | Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key) |
| 402        | Out of credits                                          |
| 403        | Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged |
| 408        | Your request timed out                                  |
| 429        | You are being rate limited                              |
| 502        | Your chosen model is down or we received an invalid response from it |
