# Fallback Models
Providing security against downtime

## Advanced Model Routing with OpenRouter

OpenRouter provides a robust feature for automatic fallback to alternative models. This ensures uninterrupted service and flexibility in handling various scenarios like primary model downtime, rate-limiting, or content moderation. Here's how you can leverage this feature in your application.

### Fallback Model Configuration

#### TypeScript Example

```typescript copy
{
  models: ["anthropic/claude-2.1", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
  route: "fallback",
  // ... other parameters
}
```

In this configuration, `models` is an array where you can specify multiple models in order of preference. The `route` parameter is set to `"fallback"`, enabling the automatic routing feature.

### How Fallback Works

- **Initial Request Handling:** When you make a request, OpenRouter first attempts to use the primary model specified (e.g., anthropic/claude-2.1).

- **Error Detection:** If the primary model is unable to process the request due to errors such as downtime, rate-limiting, or content moderation restrictions, OpenRouter detects this.

- **Fallback Activation:** Upon detecting an error with the primary model, OpenRouter automatically switches to the next model in the list (e.g., gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b).

- **Secondary Error Handling:** If the fallback model also fails (due to similar issues), OpenRouter returns the error from the fallback model.

### Error Triggers for Fallback

The fallback mechanism is triggered by various errors, including:

* Context length validation errors.
* Moderation flags for filtered models.
* Rate-limiting issues.
* Downtime or unavailability of the selected model.

### Pricing Considerations

- **Dynamic Pricing:** The cost of the request is based on the model that successfully processes it. This information is included in the `model` attribute of the response body.
- **Fallback Model Pricing:** If no fallback model is specified (`models` array contains only the primary model) but `route: "fallback"` is included, OpenRouter will automatically select an appropriate open-source model. This model will have a pricing structure close to or less than the primary model.

### Best Practices for Fallback Configuration

| Practice       | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **Multiple Models** | It's recommended to list more than one model in the `models` array for greater reliability. |
| **Model Selection** | Choose fallback models that offer similar capabilities to your primary model to maintain consistency in responses. |
| **Testing** | Regularly test your fallback configurations to ensure smooth transitions during actual fallback scenarios. |
| **Monitoring** | Keep an eye on the models' performance and adjust your configuration as needed based on new models or changes in existing models. |
