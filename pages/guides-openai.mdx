# OpenAI Integration
Use OpenRouter with the OpenAI Client.

# Guide for OpenAI Integration

This guide will help you set up OpenRouter in your application using the OpenAI client so you can take advantage of our standardized API and extensive model offerings.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for an [OpenRouter account](https://openrouter.ai/).
- Retrieve your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- If available, have your `YOUR_SITE_URL` and `YOUR_SITE_NAME` for API rankings. ***(Optional)***

## Quickstart language selection

Choose the language or tool you want to get started with using the OpenRouter API

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

## Step 1: Install OpenAI Client API

Ensure that you have the OpenAI Client API available in your environment. You can install it via npm:

```bash copy
npm install openai
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be using the OpenAI Client API to make requests to the OpenRouter API. Here's how you can set it up:

```typescript filename="OpenAI Client Request" copy
import OpenAI from "openai"

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  defaultHeaders: {
    "HTTP-Referer": process.env.YOUR_SITE_URL, // Optional, for including your app on openrouter.ai rankings.
    "X-Title": process.env.YOUR_SITE_NAME, // Optional. Shows in rankings on openrouter.ai.
  },
  // dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
})

async function main() {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }
    ],
  })

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message)
}

main()
```

Replace `process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `process.env.YOUR_SITE_URL`, and `process.env.YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual environment variables.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

The response from the OpenRouter API will be logged to the console. You can modify this to suit the needs of your application.

## Step 1: Install OpenAI Client API
Ensure you have the OpenAI Client API installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash copy
pip install openai
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

You'll be using the OpenAI Client API in Python to make requests to the OpenRouter API. Here's a basic setup:

```python filename="OpenAI Client Request" copy
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_openrouter_api_key_here"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}
  ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message)
```

Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Step 3: Handle the Response

The response from the OpenRouter API will be printed to the console. Adjust this to integrate with your application as needed.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have cURL installed in your command-line environment.

## Step 2: Set Up Your cURL Request

You'll be making a POST request to the OpenRouter API using cURL. Here's the command you'll use:

```bash copy 
curl -X POST "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_openrouter_api_key_here" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}
    ]
  }'
```

Replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Step 3: Execute the Request

Run the above command in your terminal.
