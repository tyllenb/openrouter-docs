| 401        | Invalid credentials (OAuth session expired, disabled/invalid API key) |
| 402        | Out of credits                                          |
| 403        | Your chosen model requires moderation and your input was flagged |
| 408        | Your request timed out                                  |

### Handling Errors

When interacting with the API, it's important to handle these error codes appropriately. Here are some general guidelines:

- **400 Bad Request**: Check your request parameters. Ensure all required fields are included and correctly formatted.
- **401 Invalid Credentials**: Verify your API key and ensure it's active. Refresh the OAuth session if necessary.
- **402 Out of Credits**: Review your account credits. Recharge your account or adjust your usage accordingly.
- **403 Moderation Flag**: Ensure your input adheres to the API's content guidelines.
- **408 Timeout**: Optimize your request or try again after checking your network connection.
- **429 Rate Limited**: Implement request retries with exponential backoff or reduce the frequency of requests.
- **502 Server Error**: This is often temporary. Retry the request after a short delay.
